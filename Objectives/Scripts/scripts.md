# Basic Bash

Bash is a low level programming language that is very useful for automating tasks. The reason it is a low level language is because it does not need a compiler to process it. 
It is a relatively simple language and once mastered can help in carrying out sysadmin tasks. 

BASH is not the only shell that is available on the system. To list all the shells that are , use the below command. 

		cat /etc/shells

In this document I will not be going over the basics of BASH. For that please check my other repository dedicated to [BASH](https://github.com/doctypehuman/bash)

Now let's have a look at the objectives.
