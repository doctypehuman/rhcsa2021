# Using MAN pages 

Man pages offer some great advice as to how to use a command. 

## Invoking the man page 

	man cp 

Here we invoked the man page for the cp command. You can substitute cp with any other command.


## Finding the appropriate man page 

	man -k cp 

When we use man with the option -k we are shown a list of different man pages that are available for that command. 
Man pages are numbered from 1 to 8. Each man page has a general topic. 8 is for system administration.
So whenever you are not sure which man page you need to refer to use *man -k* for a complete list. 

When in a manpage there are chances that there would be Examples of the command. 

	/EXAMPLE

The above command will help you search for the string EXAMPLE in the manpage
