## Hello GitHub !!

### This repository has been made to document my efforts and also to create notes as reference for others who would like to have a crack at RHCSA.

### The objectives that have been stated here are further explored in detail in the folder [Objectives](/Objectives)

##### This repository is an ongoing effort and will continue to develop till the exam is cleared. 
**update! Cleared my exam !!**
##### The goal is to convert this into a one page reference once all the topics are covered.

### Feel free to copy, paste and use this repository to your liking. 

_Please note that these objectives were taken from the official Red Hat website on 18.02.2021. For the latest objectives please visit [Red Hat.](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/training/ex200-red-hat-certified-system-administrator-rhcsa-exam?section=Objectives)_
